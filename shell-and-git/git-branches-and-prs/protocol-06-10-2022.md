# Notes from the first git branches session from 06.10.2022

Workflow when working with branches:

- git pull : pull all the changes in the remote repository to your local repository OR
- git init if you want to start with a new repository
- git switch -c <new branch name> : create and switch to the new branch
- git switch <branch name> : only move to another branch
- git add . : add the changes made in the repository
- git commit -m "Commit message" : commit the changes
- git push --set upstream origin <new branch name>: create the new branch in the remote repository and push the changes there
- send a pull request for other members of the team to check and comment; changes will be approved for merge (if it is the case) and then the new branch can be merged to main (and then deleted, if there aren't any changes expected to be made on that branch)
